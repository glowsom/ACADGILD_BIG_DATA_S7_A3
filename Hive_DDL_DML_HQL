Explain concepts with examples

Hive Data Definitions
Data definitions are statements which describe the data structure of an object while creating/altering/deleting the object like
databases, tables, views, partitions , etc. They usualy start with CREATE, ALTER or DELETE.

An example is: CREATE TABLE good_ppl (name string, age tinyint).
In this case, good_ppl, while it's being created, is being described (defined) as a table, which has 2 columns: name and  age. name consists of string
values, while age consists of tinyint values.
